/**
 * Declination of the Launch Asymptote (DLA), in degrees.
 *
 * DLA = arcsin(vZ / |v|) computed DIRECTLY on the departure v-infinity
 * components - NO ecliptic->equatorial rotation is applied, deliberately.
 * Slice 12 OQ-12-1 measured the porkchop pipeline's frame: Earth velocity
 * sampled from the worker's own fixture reaches |vZ| = 11.715 km/s
 * (seasonal), impossible in an ecliptic frame - the components are
 * heliocentric ICRF (equatorial-aligned) J2000. Applying the "one
 * obliquity rotation" from the pre-research summary here would introduce
 * up to ~23.4 deg of silent error. See src/v2/SLICE_12_FOUNDING.md
 * OQ-12-1 / DEC-12-2 before "fixing" this.
 *
 * Inputs are unit-agnostic (the ratio is dimensionless) but must be
 * consistent; epsilonMag is in the SAME unit as the components and
 * defaults to 1e-3 (= 1 m/s for km/s inputs, the production case).
 * Returns null when |v| < epsilonMag (DLA undefined near C3 ~ 0).
