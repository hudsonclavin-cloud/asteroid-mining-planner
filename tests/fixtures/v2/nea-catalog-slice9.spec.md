# Slice 9 NEA Catalog Fixture Spec

## Purpose

`tests/fixtures/v2/nea-catalog-slice9.json` is the production Slice 9 data fixture.
It captures the full JPL SBDB `sb-group=neo` catalog as of build time, with:

- per-object osculating elements from SBDB
- anchor state derived by propagating those SBDB elements at the element epoch
- optional Horizons re-anchor replacement for stale-element bodies
- inline quality metadata
- CAD-window-backed `inv014Tier` assignment

This fixture is data only. It does not choose renderer, spatial-index, or ui-hud behavior.

## Nullability rules

- `H` may be `null` when SBDB does not report an absolute magnitude.
- `estimatedRadiusM` must be `null` when `H` is `null`.
- `G` is `null` in Slice 9 because the bulk SBDB query does not include it.
- Quality fields may be `null` when SBDB does not report them.

## INV-014 tier assignment

The fixture does **not** numerically assign the future `planning-tier`.

- `not-kepler-safe`
  - body has at least one CAD close approach within the standard validation window
  - window is recorded in `closeApproachWindow`
- `visualization-tier`
  - body is **not** CAD-flagged in that window
- `planning-tier`
  - reserved product/policy label for Slice 10 consumption
  - distribution is expected to remain `0` in the Slice 9 fixture

The ~50,000 km visualization envelope is validated by the Slice 9 cutover harness, not recomputed per body at fixture-build time.

## Hybrid anchor semantics

Slice 9 A.2b amends the original SBDB-only anchor policy with a stale-body re-anchor pass.

- `anchorSource: "sbdb"`
  - body kept its original SBDB osculating elements and anchor
  - expected for fresh bodies (`staleness <= T`) and any non-stale anomaly-tail body
- `anchorSource: "horizons-reanchor"`
  - body exceeded the stale threshold and was refreshed from a recent Horizons state
  - `reanchorEpochTdbJd` must be present
  - `anchor.epochTdbJd`, `elements.epochTdbJd`, and `reanchorEpochTdbJd` must all match
- `anchorSource: "stale-unanchored"`
  - body exceeded the stale threshold but Horizons could not resolve a replacement anchor
  - body must be tagged `inv014Tier = "not-kepler-safe"`
  - `reanchorEpochTdbJd` must be `null`

## qualityRank

`qualityRank` is a documented scalar for future Slice 9 Phase C down-ranking. It does **not** prescribe UI visuals.

Formula:

```text
conditionScore = condition_code == null ? 0 : clamp01(1 - condition_code / 9)
dataArcScore   = data_arc_days == null ? 0 : clamp01(log10(1 + data_arc_days) / log10(1001))
qualityRank    = clamp01(0.6 * conditionScore + 0.4 * dataArcScore)
```

Interpretation:

- range is `[0, 1]`
- higher is better-constrained / longer-arc
- phase-C visuals decide how to map the scalar; the fixture only preserves it

## Anchor semantics

Slice 9 supports two anchor paths:

- SBDB path
  - `anchor` is derived by propagating each body's own SBDB osculating elements at that body's own `elements.epochTdbJd`
  - `anchorSource` is `sbdb`
- Horizons re-anchor path
  - stale bodies are refreshed from a Horizons state at a common re-anchor epoch
  - refreshed elements are derived from that state and replace the stale SBDB elements in the fixture
  - `anchorSource` is `horizons-reanchor`

For both paths:

- `anchor.epochTdbJd` must equal `elements.epochTdbJd`
- anchor vectors are stored in heliocentric ICRF/J2000 kilometers and km/s
